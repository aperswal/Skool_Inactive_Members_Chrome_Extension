Introduction
The "Inactive Members Report" Chrome extension is committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how we handle the data that our extension interacts with and assures you of the measures taken to protect your privacy.

Data Collection
Our extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or identifiable information. The extension is designed to process data locally on the user's device, and the generated CSV report is only stored on the user's local system.

Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions:

activeTab: This permission allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab where the Skool community page is open.
scripting: This permission enables the extension to execute the content script on the Skool community page to gather member activity data.
downloads: The downloads permission is necessary for the extension to export the extracted member data into a CSV file, which is stored locally.
Data Usage
The extension solely processes member data from the Skool platform to identify inactive members within a community. The data includes member names, usernames, profile links, and activity statuses. This data is only used to create a CSV file, which is stored locally on the user's device. We do not store or transmit this data to any third-party servers.

Data Sharing
We do not share any data collected or processed by the extension with third parties. The data is processed locally and remains on the user's device.

Security
We have implemented security measures within the extension to ensure that all data processed remains within the user's control. No data is stored remotely or shared with external entities.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our privacy policy periodically. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
